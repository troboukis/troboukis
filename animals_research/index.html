                In 2016 there was a 7% increase in use of animals in research labs across the United States. The data from the Department of Agriculture put the number of laboratory animals used in research at 820,812.

                <p class="body-text sub-font">
                Guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters and non human primates are the most commonly used research lab animals. The use of non-rodent animals has been declining over the past decades. This includes a fall in the number of dogs used in research. In 1979 there were over 200,000 dogs used in research. By 2016 the number has dropped to 60,979 dogs.

                In  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/science/dog-science-cats.html">a New York Times story</a> about the use of dogs in research, scientists say that "... there are good reasons dogs are studied so intensively. There are many more dog breeds — about 400 compared to about 40 cat breeds. That means more genetic diversity, and better tools for studying genomes".

                According to the NGO Releace Chimps "The overarching problem with the AWA is that it has no authority over what is done or not done for animals in actual experiments.
                There are NO laws preventing researchers from breaking bones, withholding painkillers, forcing ingestion of poisonous substances, burning, leaving animals in complete isolation for months—or other atrocities that in the real world constitute blatant and egregious animal cruelties. 
                The crucial decision of what is acceptable or unacceptable to be done to a living animal is left to each facility’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) members.
